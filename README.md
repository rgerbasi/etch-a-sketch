## TODO

- Create webpage with 16x16 grid of square divs using JS
- Use Flexbox to make divs appear as a grid
- Hover effect so grid divs change color when mouse passes over them leaving a (pixelated) trail through grid like a pen would
- Add button to the top of screen that will prompt the user for number of squares per side for new grid, once entered grid should be replaced in the same total space as before (limit 100)

### Extra
- rather than squares being same color, randomize rgb values with each interaction
- progressive darkening effect where each interaction darkens the square by 10% (fully black square in 10 interactions)
